\subsection{Router vs Switch}
A switch is a device that operates at the data link layer (2). 
It uses the MAC addresses of devices to forward network traffic between them
within the same LAN.\\
A router, on the other hand, operates at the IP layer (3).
It uses IP addresses to forward network traffic between devices that are in
different LAN's.
